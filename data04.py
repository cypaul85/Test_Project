# Exercise 4: Count the occurrence of each element from a list
# Write a program to iterate a given list and count the occurrence 
# of each element and create a dictionary to show the count of each element.

# Given:
# sample_list = [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89]

# Expected Output:
# Printing count of each item   {11: 2, 45: 3, 8: 1, 23: 2, 89: 1}

sample_list = [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89]

count_dict = dict()
for item in sample_list:
    if item in count_dict:
        count_dict[item] += 1
    else:
        count_dict[item] = 1

print("Printing count of each item  ", count_dict)
